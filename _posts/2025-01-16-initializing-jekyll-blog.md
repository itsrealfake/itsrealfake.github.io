# I've resisted having a blog for a long time

## Reasoning for the seasoning :salt_shaker:

It seems like the sort of thing that one should do if they seek to be famous. But we've been given the encouragement to do such things to make our efforts seem more concrete.

So here it is.

## How it's going

Thus far, i've followed some instructions to create this thing, and then updated the `_config.yml` file to have a `nostr_username` instead of a twitter thingy. you can find me in both places if you want, but i can assure you Nostr is going to be more interesting to me as time progresses.

I'm using emacs for a lot of my personal workflow, and it's always fun to pretend that getting work done in emacs is efficient, so that's where i've done a lot of this blog setup.

## Where it's going

presumably, i'll get into the flow with this BOSS thing and that'll get us all some useful information.
